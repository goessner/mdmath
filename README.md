## What is it ...

**mdmath** allows to use *Visual Studio Code* as a markdown editor capable of typesetting and rendering TeX math.
In fact it functions and renders identically to the built in markdown viewer. Additionally KaTeX works inside as a fast math renderer.

You can install the extension directly from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath).

### What is new in **mdmath** ...

* Support of table of Contents
* Support of Front Matter (YAML or JSON style)
* User Stylesheet
* User Settings

## Features
Simplify the process of authoring and live previewing markdown documents containing math formulas.
This extension is a comfortable tool for scientists, engineers and students with markdown as their first choice 
document format.

* Inline math by `$ ... $`
* Display math by `$$ ... $$`
* Add formula numbering by `$$ ... $$ (1)`
* Inline math with tables
* Embedded HTML
* Syntax highlighting with code sections
* Export resulting HTML code for web usage

## Test Table

Some math expressions are collected in a [test table](http://goessner.github.io/mdmath/test/).

## Installation ...

### ... from inside of VSCode

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> key inside of *Visual Studio Code* and type `extension`. Choose `Extensions: Install Extension`

## FAQ

* __Which functions does KaTeX support ?__
  * See them listed at [KaTeX Reference](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/wiki/Function-Support-in-KaTeX).
* __The preview window does not scroll in sync with source window__
  * No. Maybe VSCode's new native preview window behavior is supported in future.
* __What if I need to use the currency symbol `$` also in my markup ?__
  * It should be safe to use it. If in doubt escape it.
* __What are the restrictions with inline formulas ?__
  * Whitespace after opening `$` and before closing `$` is not allowed.
  * Numeric character before opening `$` and after closing `$` is not allowed.
  * At least one character (whitespace ?) is required between two consecutive inline formulas.
  * Line break inside is not allowed.
* __What are the restrictions with display formulas ?__
  * Not allowed inline of text. Write them on a separate line.
  * Restrictions for inline formulas do not apply.
* __Can I use math markup in blockquotes ?__
  * We can use inline and display formulas in blockquote sections. In order to avoid the blockquote symbol `'>'` being part of a multiline display formula, display formulas have to be written on a single line in blockquote sections.
* __Can I use math markup in code blocks ?__
  * In order to prevent converting formulas in code blocks you must escape the enclosing dollars as in `\$\frac{a}{b}\$`.
* __Can I access the HTML source of the markdown file ?__
  * Yes. Use the <kbd>Markdown: Clip Markdown+Math to Html</kbd> command or the key binding (`'ctrl+K .'`). Please note, to have the markdown source window activated here (not the preview window!).
* __Can I prepend a frontmatter section to my markdown file ?__
  * Yes. That section is displayed depending on the `markdown.previewFrontMatter` setting. Its default value is `hide`, which supresses output. You can either use a *yaml* (`--- ... ---`) or a *JSON* (`{{{...}}}`) frontmatter section.
* __Is PDF output supported ?__
  * Not directly. In order to create `*.pdf` output from your Markdown you can create a `*.html` document first and print it then using a `PDF` printer or use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).
* __I cannot open multiple preview windows.__
  *  Opening multiple preview windows is not possible at current. Even changing the active markdown source window doesn't update the preview window properly. Close the preview window first as a workaround here.
* __How to automatically generate a table of contents ?__
  *  Set `mdmath.toc.enabled` in user settings to `true` first. Then add the string `[[toc]]` at your document location, where you want the table of content appear. Please note, that only heading levels *two* and *three* are collected. They are prepended by a permalink symbol `#`. This behavior can also be fine tuned by user settings.
* __Can I use custom CSS styles for the preview window ?__
  *  Yes. Set `mdmath.style` in user settings to the location of your custom CSS file. Its path must be relative to this extension root.
