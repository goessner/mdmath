## What is it ...

**mdmath** allows to use *Visual Studio Code* as a markdown editor capable of typesetting and rendering TeX math.
In fact it functions and renders identically to the built in markdown viewer. Additionally KaTeX works inside as a fast math renderer.

You can install the extension directly from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath).

**mdmath** supports ...

* Formula numbers.
* Footnotes

## Features
Simplify the process of authoring and live previewing markdown documents containing math formulas.
This extension is a comfortable tool for scientists, engineers and students with markdown as their first choice 
document format.

* Inline math by `$ ... $`
* Display math by `$$ ... $$`
* Add formula numbering by `$$ ... $$ (1)`
* Inline math with tables
* Embedded HTML
* Syntax highlighting with code sections
* Export resulting HTML code for web usage

## Test Table

Some math expressions are collected in a [test table](http://goessner.github.io/mdmath/test/).

## Installation ...

>*Note*: Attempts to show HTML output with *Preview Window* as *Active Window* result in a warning `Cannot show source of that document!`. Make your markdown source window *active* first.

You can see HTML export of [`triangle.md`](triangle.md) live in [your browser](http://goessner.github.io/mdmath/triangle.html).

## Dependencies

* [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it): The markdown renderer also used in VS Code.
* [`katex`](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX): This is where credits for fast rendering TeX math in HTML go to.
* [`markdown-it-footnote`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote): Using footnotes in markdown.
* [`highlight.js`](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js): The code highlighter also used in VS Code.

## FAQ

* __Which functions does KaTeX support ?__
  * See them listed at [KaTeX Reference](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/wiki/Function-Support-in-KaTeX).
* __The preview window does not scroll in sync with source window__
  * No, not as long as VSCode's native preview window isn't able to do that.
* __What if I need to use the currency symbol `$` also in my markup ?__
  * It should be safe to use it. If in doubt escape it.
* __What are the restrictions with inline formulas ?__
  * Whitespace after opening `$` and before closing `$` is not allowed.
  * Numeric character before opening `$` and after closing `$` is not allowed.
  * At least one character (whitespace ?) is required between two consecutive inline formulas.
  * Line break inside is not allowed.
* __What are the restrictions with display formulas ?__
  * Not allowed inline of text. Write them on a separate line.
  * Restrictions for inline formulas do not apply.
* __Can I use math markup in code blocks ?__
  * In order to prevent converting formulas in code blocks you must escape the enclosing dollars as in `\$\frac{a}{b}\$`.


## Issues, Hints

* In order to create `*.pdf` output from your Markdown you should consider using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).
* Opening multiple preview windows is not possible at current. Even changing the active markdown source window 
  doesn't update the preview window properly. Close the preview window first as a workaround here.
